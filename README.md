# Object Oriented Javascript

### Big Picture

Project for Udacity int. Javascript course. Builds an infographic that is based on data derived from the json file, as well as user input data. Pulls in information from a form and using it to complete an array of objects that will then be appended back to the DOM.

On successful form validation, 3x3 grid of tiles (9 in total) is generated with the human in the center tile. Each title will contain the species, an image, and a fact. For the human tile, the name of the human and "Homo sapiens" species is shown. The facts displayed are random per dinosaur based on 6 different types of facts. One of the tiles is for a pigeon in which always “All birds are considered dinosaurs.” is displayed.
